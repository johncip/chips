# Chips!

Chips! is a WIP Javascript remake of *[Chip's Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge)*, a puzzle game created in 1989 by Chuck Sommerville.

This project is built on top of [Phaser CE](http://phaser.io/).

Thanks to [FelixNemis](http://cczone.invisionzone.com/index.php?/files/file/238-felix-challenge/) for the awesome tileset.

Current progress:

- I've recreated levels 1-6 from the Windows version by hand in Tiled. I hope to eventually write something which will read in community-created level packs.
- I'm currently updating the code to use ES6 classes. After that I hope to move to Phaser 3.
