# Chips!

**[https://play-chips.herokuapp.com](https://play-chips.herokuapp.com)**

Chips! is a WIP Javascript remake of [Chip's Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge), a puzzle game created in 1989 by Chuck Sommerville.

This project is built on top of [Phaser CE](http://phaser.io/).

Thanks to [FelixNemis](http://cczone.invisionzone.com/index.php?/files/file/238-felix-challenge/) for the awesome tileset.

#### Current progress

- I've recreated levels 1-6 from the Windows version by hand in Tiled.
- I've modified the original version of this to be buildable with npm & webpack, and to use Phaser CE.

#### To do

- Migrate to Phaser 3
- Be able to read in existing level packs
- Better motion
- Options menu (choose tileset, etc.)
- Make it resizeable
- Have a mod music jukebox
